- 👋 Hi, I’m @faizanxgp
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of new developments in the technology industry because I am a Solution Consultant
- 🌱 I’m searching for a way to develop custom software that can work with AmazFit smartwatches and figure out how to make a custom ROM for AmazFit, which is next to impossible without the current OS Code being public, and thus my white whale. Nonetheless, a man can hope. My inability to root the watch and have custom features on it irks me daily, but this is something I have put on the back burner for now.
- I spend my days learning Python and Java to move from a hardcore LAMP to a more diversified MEAN/MERN.
- This move is also partly prompted by the rise of ChatGPT and my new obsession with Business Process Automation.
- I'm looking into LLMs and Chat Bots, as I hear that's what all the cool kids are doing these days.
- P.S.: While I am a solution architect and senior LAMP Developer, I consider myself a novice in Java and Python, but I'm getting better with time and practice.
- P.S.: I have newly discovered the world of knowledge management systems and have been obsessed with Obsidian building my own second brain since I read the book Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte.
- 💞️ Always happy to talk all things tech. Always looking to collaborate and synergize.

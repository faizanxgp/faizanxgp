- 👋 Hi, I’m @faizanxgp
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of new developments in the technology industry because I am a Solution Consultant
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop tools that can work with AmazFit smart watches. 
You all might know that AmazFit watches run their own custom OS and I got a watch as a gift from someone.
My inability to root the watch and have custom features on it is something that irks me daily. So I decided to make my own custom ROM for the watch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making first off a very basic simple hello world application for my smart watch and then we will see where we go next

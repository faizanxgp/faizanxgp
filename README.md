- 👋 Hi, I’m @faizanxgp
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of new developments in the technology industry because I am a Solution Consultant
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop tools that can work with AmazFit smart watches as well as trying to figure out how to make a cusom ROM for AmazFit without havingthe curent OS Code.
My inability to root the watch and have custom features on it is something that irks me daily and so this is how I choose to spend my free time. Making my own custom ROM for the watch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making first off a very basic simple hello world application for my smart watch and then we wil see where we go next
- 📫 How to reach me feel free to call/whatsapp me on 00923334083492 or email me at mianfaizanxgp@gmail.com / mian@teamonline.pk/ teamonlinepk@gmail.com

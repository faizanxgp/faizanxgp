- 👋 Hi, I’m @faizanxgp
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of new developments in the technology industry because I am a Solution Consultant
- 🌱 I after searching for 3 years found a way to develop custom software that works with AmazFit smartwatches essentially  a Mod of ZepOS and customized my mothers 80$ 6 year old Amazfit BipU device to work at near medical accuracy and with a wide array of additional features and customizations to help with her illness. 
- I spend my days during the COVID lock down learning Python and Java to move from my hardcore LAMP Laravel background as I foresaw this AI Bubbble and thanks to that I was fully equiped to call myself an algorithms guy on top of solutions architect and devops by the time AI and ML became cool. Thanks to that I was a beta tester on ChatGPT, AM a beta tester on Azure AI API, currently part of Microsoft Founders Hub and former Microsoft BizSpark holder back in 2015-2016.
- P.S.: I have newly discovered the world of knowledge management systems and have been obsessed with Obsidian building my own second brain since I read the book Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte and these days I'm working on two super cool projects:
- One fired by my obsession to measure and documment, I am working to integrate my ticktick task management app with Obsidian my second brain but there is a catch. Mine is a 3-way solution which also includes Rize.io a producitvity and time tracking app. So basically the task being performed/me alerted on what to do comes from ticktick, Rize.io measures my productivty and how serious and focused I was during that work session and finally that data gets stored in my Obsidian Second Brain where using dataview I get custom metrics and measures that tell me how productive I am how much fun I'm having and/or how much my workload is. The solution is thus far 4 months into development and I don't see it ending anytime soon.

- My second currennt pet prooject that I cannot speak much about owing to non-disclosures signed withh Microsoft ;-)
- I am leveraging NuGet Packages and .Net framework to use software development and coding to fill in the gaps currently found in MIcrosoft's Dataverse of so-called low-code solution systems.
- This project that's been going on for almost two months is so hard that I at the timme of writing actually sold my soul to the devil and changed the GitHub Organization my profile is attached to in exchange for free CoPilot.
- This project is going to be the death of me. But if you've read this far you will know I thought the same of every software development and programing challenge I took up and might I add here that I am a self taught developer and only ever wrote code or did development for fun or out of curiosity never as a professional endeavor.
- 💞️ Always happy to talk all things tech.
- Always looking to collaborate and synergize.
